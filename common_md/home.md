**I'm a _computer science_ student interested on _ReactJS_, _Typescript_ and other similar technologies.**

I am 18 years old, and have been working on the _web_ for about 2.5 years now. I love building new stuff, lately I have been working on a mental health app called [Release](Release/Release.md). I also like writing about whatever I find cool/interesting stuff, have a look at my [blog](Blog/All%20posts.md).
